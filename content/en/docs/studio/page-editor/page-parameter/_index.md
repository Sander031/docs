## 1 Introduction 

A page parameter is an input that needs to be passed from the calling page or a microflow to the current page. Page parameters determine information that can be reused on the page. For example, if you would like to build an **Employee_Details_Edit** page, the page will have a parameter **Employee**. This means that when this page is called an Employee object needs to be passed to it to show the corresponding Employee data.

Page parameters provide context to data views and allow you to use multiple objects that do not have an association.

You can pass multiple objects when opening a page the same way microflows do. For example, you can add multiple top-level data views, each connected to a different parameter and displaying data from their entities: you can show Employee’s data in one data view and Order’s data in another data view adding two page parameters to the page.

Page parameters can be referred to from both top-level data views and data views placed inside other data views. Additionally, you can select associations of a page parameter, which means you do not have to use an additional data view just to be able to follow the association. 

## 2 Properties

Parameter consists of the following general properties:

* [Entity](#entity)
* [Name](#name)

### 2.1 Entity {#entity}

The entity of the parameter. When the page is opened, an object of this entity type should be passed to it. This object can be used by data views, i.e. data from this entity will be shown in a data view. 

### 2.2 Name {#name}

The name of the parameter, displayed in blue.
