## 1 Introduction 

Workflow is a visual language in Mendix Studio and Mendix Studio Pro that allows you to build extendable processes. It is fully integrated with other visual languages, such as microflow editor and page editor. 

The **Workflow** category contains Studio how-tos on workflows and will help you build a workflow using the wizard or manually depending on your use case. 

For more general guidelines on workflows, see [Workflows](/studio/workflows/) in the *Studio 9 Guide*.
